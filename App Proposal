GRASP MODEL for Application Development Concept Proposal
GOALS
- The goal is to propose an app that aligns to the international agenda of the United Nations-the 2030 Sustainable Goals and all of the outputs must be in accordance of the 17 SDGS.

ROLES
- We are the mobile/web app developer. 

AUDIENCE
- For this application proposal my audience would be the FARMERS.

SITUATION
- The situation I'll address are the small-scale farmers that struggles with fair pricing, market access, and sustainable farming practices.
- On today's era we could understand that small-scale farmers may not have the means to access information they needed to improve their crop productions leading to poor crop quality and shortage of harvests crops.

PRODUCT/PERFORMANCE/OUTPUT
1. OBJECTIVE
- APP NAME: AgriSync - a platform that enables farmers to connect with with buyers, agricultural experts, and sustainable farming resources.
- Purpose: This app would help farmers reduce food waste, crop production costs for purchasing pesticides and equipments (due to location and distance), improve food security, and support sustainable agriculture by bridging the gap between farmers and consumers.
- Problem: Farmers may not have the means to access information they needed to improve their crop productions leading to poor crop quality and shortage of harvests crops.
- Solution: This application will help farmers sell directly to consumers, access expert advice, and learn eco-friendly farming methods.

2. KEY SDGs TARGETED
- SDG 2: ZERO HUNGER - Helps increase food production and access to fresh food.
        - this will help the farmers earn what they deserved and people won't need to go far to buy food.
- SDG 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH - Supports small-scale farmers by ensuring fair trade opportunities.
        - this will help our farmers to be able to compete on the market fairly and provides them with costumer.
- SDG 12: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION - Reduces food waste by connecting farmers directly with buyers.
        - the food produced by our local farmers will be bought and not go to waste.

3. KEY FEATURES
        1. MARKETPLACE: this is where the buyers could directly communicate with the farmers to purchase goods from them. Farmers could list their fresh products for direct sales.
                        - consumers can buy locally grown foods that may help reduce carbon footprints.
        2. FARMING TIPS & TUTORIALS: Provides video tutorials on organic farming, water conservation, and pest control. This feature may also be available to the consumers so they could also learn and understand how these crops they're buying was grown.
                        -Supports climate-resilient farming techniques
        3. COMMUNITY FORUM & EXPERT CONSULTATION - farmers can ask experts about farming challenges, techniques, and other things related to farming. Consumers could also ask the farmers and experts and they could have a public forum for inquiries.
